# Golden Apps

## What is a “golden app”?

A **golden app** is an app generated by the builder that we intentionally keep in git under:

- `outputs/golden/`

These apps are the “known-good examples” that prove the builder can generate real, working projects.

## Why do golden apps exist?

Golden apps give us:

1) **A stable target to validate**
- If `validate:all` passes on `outputs/golden/`, generation outputs are runnable.

2) **A drift detector**
- If a change accidentally alters generator outputs, golden validation and contracts catch it.

3) **Fast confidence**
- Anyone can run one command and see the system working end-to-end.

## What golden apps are NOT

- Not hand-maintained “source code”.
- Not a place for experiments.
- Not a dumping ground for runtime outputs.

Golden apps are builder outputs kept as trusted fixtures.

## Rules for changing golden apps

Golden apps should change only when you intentionally change generation behavior.

Legitimate reasons:
- template change (feature/bug fix/refactor that affects output)
- structure or naming intentionally changed
- manifest contents intentionally changed

Illegitimate reasons:
- nondeterministic output (timestamps, random IDs, env-specific paths)
- runtime artifacts got committed (logs, out dirs, temp files, node_modules)

If you’re unsure: treat golden drift as a bug until proven otherwise.
